# pdftitle

The commandline tool `pdftitle` is a Python implementation of the
*SciPlore Xtract*[1] paper, using mostly a structural layout analysis.

By now, Docear has published the open-source tool
[PDF Inspector](https://github.com/Docear/PDF-Inspector) which does roughly the
same as this script. The differences are:

- Written in Java
- Uses ~~PDFBox~~ *jPod* instead of *pdftohtml*
- Simplier heuristics

## Background

The title of a PDF article usually is in the filename but often is not. Next up
would be to check the title of the PDF metadata (using e.g. `pdfinfo`) but this
is also often not set or set incorrectly. Converting the PDF to text and picking
the first line often gives false positives or incomplete titles.

## Usage

    $ pdftitle --help
    usage: pdftitle [-h] [-r] [-m] [-s] [-t TOP_MARGIN] [-n MIN_LENGTH]
                    [-x MAX_LENGTH] [-d] [-v]
                    FILE [FILE ...]

    Tries to identify the title of PDF format paper.

    positional arguments:
      FILE                  Path to PDF file(s)

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -r, --rename          Rename file with found title
      -m, --multiline       Concatenate multiple title lines considered (default)
      -s, --singleline      Only use first title line considered
      -t TOP_MARGIN, --top-margin TOP_MARGIN
                            Top margin start to search for title (default: 70)
      -n MIN_LENGTH, --min-length MIN_LENGTH
                            Min. considerable title length (default: 15)
      -x MAX_LENGTH, --max-length MAX_LENGTH
                            Max. considerable title length (default: 250)
      -d, --debug           Print error stacktrace for unknown errors
      -v, --version         show program's version number and exit

## Dependencies

  * Python >=2.5 (but < 3.x)
  * [Poppler](http://poppler.freedesktop.org/) >=0.20.5 (contains `pdftohtml`)

      `$ brew install poppler`

  * [lxml](http://lxml.de/) (optional, for higher accuracy)

      `$ pip install lxml`


## Accuracy

Version 1.0: A sample set of 261 PDFs in Biology science (which has many
scanned PDFs) results in 60.08% success rate.

Version 1.1: A sample set of 261 PDFs in Biology science (which has many
scanned PDFs) results in 76.25% success rate.

Version 1.2: No comparison available. (I lost the original sample set)

Version 1.3: No comparison available. (I lost the original sample set)
